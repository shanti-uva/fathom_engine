Our focus is to make advanced technology widely and easily available to most faculty and students, and then build new patterns of community interaction to support the use of such technology and exploration of how it can help individuals and groups in sustainable ways.  Our programs include the deployment of community tools that are powerful, easy to use, and interoperable; our year-long Cohorts Fellowship to support groups of faculty, staff, and students with shared interests to use technologies to further their projects; the present portal with its profiling and networking facilities; and a curricular initiative aimed at broadening student understanding of digital technology.'
