Our programs include the deployment of community tools that are powerful, easy to use, and interoperable; our year-long Cohorts Fellowship to support groups of faculty, staff, and students with shared interests to use technologies to further their projects; the present portal with its profiling and networking facilities; and a curricular initiative aimed at broadening student understanding of digital technology.'
